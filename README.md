# sqlWriteR
R package for writing SQL Queries to pass into functions as a single character string

This is a basic package for use in writing SQL Queries into character strings for use in R functions, such as those in the RODBC package.

Currently this package is in an early state and is intended primarily for use within the context of my workplace, but it available here for all to use.

I'm relatively new to R, so I'm sure there are plenty of ways I can improve this package.  Any and all feedback is welcome!
